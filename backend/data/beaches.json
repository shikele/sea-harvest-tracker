      "notes": "Please take care not to cover oysters with sand and mud while digging clams because this will potentially kill the oysters. Potlatch State Park has over a mile of tidelands, but some areas provide better digging for different species. The stretch of beach that is closest to the highway is regularly harvested by recreational diggers, and good numbers of Manila clams can be found here. Manila clams can be found throughout the middle and upper intertidal zones, with greatest abundance on the large tide flat at the southern end of Annas Bay where the park’s shoreline turns easterly. Native littleneck clams are present throughout the beach, but in lower abundance and usually lower in tidal elevation than Manila clams. The best digging for butter clams is in front of the main parking area in the lower intertidal zone. Butter clams are also common in the lower intertidal zone throughout the south end of the beach. Varnish clams are found in great abundance all along the southern shoreline of Potlatch State Park and Potlatch DNR, usually in the upper intertidal zone. Eastern softshell clams can be found at Potlatch State Park, particularly in areas with freshwater influence from Enetai Creek (also the site of the Skokomish Fisheries Department fish trap). Potlatch DNR is a good beach for butter clams. The best digging is in the middle intertidal zone in sand and mixed sand/gravel. There are some good spots for Manila and native littleneck clams in the middle and upper intertidal zones. Eastern softshell and Varnish clams are also found at Potlatch DNR, usually in the middle and upper intertidal zones. Potlatch State Park is an excellent beach for oysters. There are extensive oyster beds in the stretch of beach near the highway, as well as north and east of Enetai Creek. Potlatch DNR is a good beach for oysters, but they are more abundant at Potlatch State Park. Tidelands to the east of the Potlatch DNR boundary are owned by The Skokomish Tribal Nation. Non-consumptive recreational use is permitted. All shellfish harvest is strictly prohibited on these tidelands. (See Beach Map)",

Manila clams are not abundant on Hope Island, but there is one good spot on the extreme south end of the island in patches of sand and gravel substrate. There are butter clams on this beach.

A brackish lagoon drains through these gravel beds. Clam species available at Spencer Spit State Park include: native littleneck clams, varnish clams, butter clams, and cockles.

These two adjacent beaches cover a long stretch of beach, consisting of 4,376 feet of public shoreline. The boundary division between the two beaches is marked by the dock that extends from Captain Whidbey Inn on Madrona Road. Uplands south and east of the Madrona Road access (heading toward Coupeville) are private property. Please do not trespass on private uplands. These beaches feature a variety of substrate types. The West Penn Cove section has a wide productive gravel-mud clam band, which narrows at points and widens in embayments. There is good digging for butter clams, native littleneck clams, cockles and horse clams on most of West Penn Cove. The littleneck clams tend to be higher on the beach, while the butter and horse clams are lower in the intertidal zone. The area below the north access trail at Grasser's Lagoon (Highway 20) is particularly good digging. This is an excellent site for harvesting mussels, primarily near the south Mueller's/Madrona Road access. Twin Lagoons tidelands are rocky and more challenging to dig but a small tideflat at the outflow for the Twin Lagoons provides good butter clam digging. Access to this area is by foot southward along the shoreline from the Madrona Road access. There is no direct upland access to Twin Lagoons.",

Over the past several years the substrate has shifted from primarily gravel towards more of a mud and sand substrate, leading to a decline of native littleneck clams. The most productive clam habitat is a relatively small area of mixed gravel towards the point. The area inside of the spit and towards the southern end of the beach is primarily mud and sand and is not good clam habitat. You may also find horse clams and eastern softshell clams here.",
